ebms-admin is a standalone EbMS adapter that uses an embedded Jetty server. ebms-admin exposes a Web and a SOAP interface over HTTP(S) to manage the EbMS adapter and it uses a database to store the data. ebms-admin is configured through command line options and a properties file. It also supports basic and client certificate authentication for the Web and SOAP interfaces.
