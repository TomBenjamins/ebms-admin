# Introduction

The ebms-admin app is a fully functional EbMS adapter that uses the ebms-core jar for this. The ebms-admin app consists of an ebms-adapter and a Web and a SOAP interface to manage the EbMS adapter. The EbMS adapter is configured through the ebms-admin properties file that can be generated in the EbMSAdminPropertiesPage. The Web and SOAP interfaces are configured through the application's command line properties (see [Command Line Options]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link ebms-admin/command.md %}) for examples). It supports HTTPS for the Web and SOAP interfaces as well as basic and client certificate authentication.
